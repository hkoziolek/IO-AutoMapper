Group all rows that have "qualifies": "yes"
- Find the minimum rowNumber and call that "start row".
- Find the maximum rowNumber and call that "end row".
- Return a list of objects: 
  [
    {{
      "tag": "...",
      "startRow": ...,
      "endRow": ...
    }},
    ...
  ]

For a group use as tag the common prefix of all tags of the group (e.g., 123-AB100 for 123-AB100-UA1, 123-AB100-UX).
If a device has multiple sets of qualifying rows that do not overlap, merge them into a single continuous block if they do overlap, or create separate blocks if they don't. 
Non-overlapping blocks are allowed only if there's a gap in rowNumber.
